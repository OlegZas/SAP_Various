Variables are like placeholders that stand in for different pieces of information or values in place of a Territory, Fixed Value, Rate Table, or Lookup Table.
•	Imagine you have a bunch of rules for how to pay salespeople, but each salesperson might have a different territory, bonus amount, or commission rate. Instead of making a separate set of rules for each salesperson, you can use variables to represent these different values.
•	So, instead of saying "if Terry sells in this territory, pay him this bonus," you can say "If a salesperson sells in their assigned territory, pay them their assigned bonus." Variables for: territory and bonus
