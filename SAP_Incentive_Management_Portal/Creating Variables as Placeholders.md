**Variables** are like placeholders that stand in for different pieces of information or values in place of a *Territory*, *Fixed Value*, *Rate Table*, or *Lookup Table*.

Imagine you have a bunch of rules for how to pay salespeople, but each salesperson might have a different territory, bonus amount, or commission rate. Instead of making a separate set of rules for each salesperson, you can use variables to represent these different values.

So, instead of saying "if Terry sells in this territory, pay him this bonus," you can say "If a salesperson sells in their assigned territory, pay them their assigned bonus." Variables for: *territory* and *bonus*
