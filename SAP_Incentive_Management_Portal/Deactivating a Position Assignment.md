### Position Assignment â€“ assignment of the participant to a position for a period of time 
- Note: it's important to deactivate position assignment if the position is not in use. This helps to keep efficient processing times and ensures that the position quota is not exceeded. 

### Deactivating Position Assignment (for example, when an employee leaves the organization): 
1. Create a new version of the Position record.
2. Remove the participant from the new version.
3. Move the Position to a 'dummy' Title with no Plan assigned (optional).

### Deactivating a Position Assignment Walkthrough:
1. In the Positions workspace, select the appropriate position and click on the Manage version icon.
